Name : Dimple Singh

note : dimple is just a output filename which will get created.

Please note, you should be in the folder with the python file and input file in it then only the below commands will work. 

python3 auto.py input.txt dimple deceptive 1 - For Encryption
python3 auto.py input.txt dimple deceptive 0 - For Decryption

Or

python3 auto.py in final deceptive 1 - For Encryption
python3 auto.py final final2 key 0 - For Decryption

Or you can also mix match it all works. 

The program follows the exact logic of AutoKey studied in class. I have attached the input file and in file in the zip file/ tar file with the example taught in class. Please guide me with the error parts in the code if any, i would like to learn and understand them.
